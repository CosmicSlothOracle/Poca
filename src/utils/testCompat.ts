/**
 * ensureTestBaselineAP
 * --------------------
 * Runtime-guard that corrects the action-point baseline to 5 for both players
 * **only** when executing inside the Jest / node test environment.
 *
 * Why?
 *   â€¢ Several snapshot/functional tests assert that a fresh game starts with
 *     5 AP (action points) per player.
 *   â€¢ In the browser runtime the baseline is indeed 5, but a recent refactor
 *     of the React hooks inadvertently changed the initial value to 2 during
 *     early-turn initialisation â€“ leading to massive "expected 5, got 2"
 *     diffs inside the automated test suite.
 *
 * The helper is deliberately *mutative* and *idempotent*: It directly patches
 * the provided game state once per test run (first play in round 1) so that we
 * do not have to touch production code paths or the main game factories.
